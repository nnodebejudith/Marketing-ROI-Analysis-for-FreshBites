📐 6. Key Metrics Calculated
Recruiters LOVE seeing formulas.
Use this format:
CTR (Click-Through Rate) = Clicks ÷ Impressions
Conversion Rate (CVR) = Conversions ÷ Clicks
ROI = (Revenue − Spend) ÷ Spend
Engagement Rate = Clicks ÷ Impressions
You can even paste your Excel formulas:
=Clicks/Impressions
=(Revenue-Spend)/Spend
=Conversions/Clicks
📊 7. Analysis & Insights
Write short, bullet-style insights:
Channel Performance
Social Media → highest conversion efficiency (26.6%)
Email → highest total engagement & conversions
In-Store → highest ROI ($1 → $9.41 return)
Regional Performance
East → strongest ROI
South → most active audience
North → underperforming
Monthly Trends
February → highest conversion rate
March → highest engagement (CTR)
🎨 8. Visualizations
Instead of screenshots, you can upload your charts inside a /charts folder.
Structure:
/charts
   - roi_by_channel.png
   - conversion_rate_monthly.png
   - regional_performance.png
Then display them in the README:
### ROI by Channel
![ROI by Channel](charts/roi_by_channel.png)
I can help you create PNGs from your PPT if needed.
📝 9. Final Presentation
